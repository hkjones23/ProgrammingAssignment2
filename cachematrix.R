##Introducing the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment 
##that is different from the current environment. 
##Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's it's inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", containing a function to
##set the value of the matrix
##get the value of the matrix
##set the value of the inverse
##get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
##However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
##If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
##Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the MakeCacheMatrix function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setmean(i)
  i
}
}
